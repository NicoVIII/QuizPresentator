# QuizPresentator
The goal of this project is to provide a tool to simply present a quiz. It should be a tool for a moderator of a quiz on a party or something similar.

## Customisation
### Questions
Questions can be customised via the quiz.txt file. Every question has to be in one line and the parameter have to be seperated by ":".

This are the six arguments which are necessary to define a question:

1. Question
2. Correct answer (use a letter A-D in upper or lower case or a number 1-4)
3. Answer 1
4. Answer 2
5. Answer 3
6. Answer 4

## Handling
Use "space" to go through the screens. If there is a question, use the F1-F4 keys or 1-4 keys to choose an answer. Use "space" again to show the result and another time to go to the next question.
