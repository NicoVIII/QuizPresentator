# QuizPresentator
The goal of this project is to provide a tool to simply present a quiz. It should be a tool for a moderator of a quiz on a party or something similar.

## Usage
At the moment it is not possible to use own questions, because this is just a prototype!

Use "space" to go through the screens. If there is a question, use the F1-F4 keys or 1-4 keys to choose an answer. Use "space" again to show the result and another time to go to the next question.
